\usage{
sample_pum_static(
  vote_info,
  data_process = list(leg_rm = NULL, combine_leg_name = NULL, combine_leg_party = NULL,
    lop_leg = 0.6, lop_issue = 0),

  iter_config,
  pos_leg = "SCALISE",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vote_info}{A vote matrix (or a rollcall object) in which rows represent members and columns represent issues.}

\item{data_process}{A list of parameters for data preprocessing:
- `leg_rm`: A list of legislators to be removed.
- `combine_leg_name` and `combine_leg_party`: Vectors for merging legislators' votes by name and party.
- `lop_leg`: The proportion of missing votes that warrants removing a legislator.
- `lop_issue`: The threshold of minority votes below which an issue will be excluded.}

\item{hyperparams}{A list of hyperparameter values:
- `beta_mean`: Prior mean for beta.
- `beta_var`: Variance of beta.
- `alpha_mean`: A vector of two components representing the prior means of `alpha1` and `alpha2`.
- `alpha_scale`: Scale parameter for `alpha1` and `alpha2`.
- `delta_mean`: A vector of two components representing the prior means of `delta1` and `delta2`.
- `delta_scale`: Scale parameter for `delta1` and `delta2`.}

\item{iter_config}{A list of iteration configurations:
- `num_iter`: Total number of iterations. It is recommended to set this to at least 30,000 to ensure reliable results.
- `start_iter`: Iteration number to start retaining data after burn-in.
- `keep_iter`: Interval at which iterations are kept for posterior samples.
- `flip_rate`: Probability of directly flipping signs in the M-H step, rather than resampling from the priors.}

\item{pos_leg}{Name of the legislator whose position is kept positive.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prints progress and additional information during the sampling process.}
}
\value{
A list primarily containing:
  - `beta`: A matrix of posterior samples for `beta`.
  - `alpha1`: A matrix of posterior samples for `alpha1`.
  - `alpha2`: A matrix of posterior samples for `alpha2`.
  - `delta1`: A matrix of posterior samples for `delta1`.
  - `delta2`: A matrix of posterior samples for `delta2`.
  - `vote_info`: The vote object after data preprocessing.

\description{
This function generates posterior samples of all parameters based on the static probit unfolding model.
